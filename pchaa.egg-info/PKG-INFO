# Project Goals

The goal of the project is to create a beautiful experience for Terminals users. All of the alternative versions for such projects were ElectronJS based, I needed something minimal with easy to update custom search algorithms

**Install dependancies**
```
pip install python-libxdo prompt_toolkit 
```

**Run**
```
python main.py
```

## Next steps:

Clean and filter the bash history and integrate Naive Bayes algorithm for next command prediction
